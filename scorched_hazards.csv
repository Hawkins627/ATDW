description
"Encounter. Roll a Planetside Encounter."
"A treacherous geyser field. While crossing, steaming water unexpectedly bursts from the ground—characters must pass a DEX check or suffer D20 damage from the boiling water."
"A sludge-covered plain, difficult to traverse (+1🜂)."
"The ground shakes violently, throwing all crew members to their knees. There’s a 1 in 6 chance boulders fall from a nearby mountain—each crew member must pass a DEX check or suffer D4 wounds."
"A winged horror the size of a horse suddenly appears, diving toward a random character—they must pass a DEX check or be snatched away by the creature, who drops them from a height of 2D20 feet."
"A stone structure, clearly artificial, stands amid a lake of lava. When approached it begins to vibrate, causing a deep bone-shattering sound. All characters must pass a CON check or simultaneously vomit and relieve themselves inside their suits (-2 to all actions until they can clean themselves)."
"The ground collapses out from under the characters’ feet. Every character takes D20 damage and they must find a way back up the 20+2D20’ fall."
"A thick cloud of dense smoke impedes visibility, forcing the crew to wait in place for +D4🜂."
"A strong wind which quickly turns into a violent hurricane of ash and dust. The crew must find shelter and remain there for D10 Time Tracks."
