title,description
"Prison","An unfortunate necessity in any society, or perhaps a place to contain external threats."
"Refinery","A place for refining the Ársaidh’s many materials and sources of energy."
"Bio Research and Containment","A place to study, evaluate and even contain the many lifeforms the Ársaidh came across."
"Temple","Whether or not the Ársaidh were religious, some of their facilities offer no purpose other than a space for spiritual enlightenment and contemplation."
"Data Storage","Facilities necessary among any sufficiently advanced society, in which all their information and knowledge is stored."
"Military","The Ársaidh were as familiar with war as humanity, judging by their many weapon-looking devices. Military facilities are always a priority for Drake Industries, so finding one is always good news."
"Aesthetic","A Site built purely for enjoyment, be it an architectural wonder or impressive garden. These Sites are often close to spectacular views such as nebulae or gorgeous planetary landscapes."
"Communications","A sort of relay center, usually full of data storage and interesting technology."
"Residential","Small colonies or stations, ranging from a few hundred homes to incredibly complex megacities."
"Teaching","A center of knowledge and study designed to facilitate access to databases and the imparting of said knowledge to large groups of students."
"Spaceport","A key part of any interplanetary travel network. Unfortunately, the few spaceports that have been found had no ships whatsoever."
"Watchpost","The Ársaidh seem to have identified many threats, most of them hopefully long gone. Watchposts may offer little explanation of their placement, but many were built to keep tabs on dangerous astronomical or planetary phenomena."
"Vault","A Site built to protect something of value (at least to the Ársaidh)."
"Medical Research and Care","These Sites are of great interest to xenobiologists, who hope to learn more about Ársaidh physiology."
"Refuge","Judging by their construction and the weapon systems within, these Sites were built to protect occupants from some kind of external threat."
"Power Center","This can be anything from an energy production facility to a fuel relay station."
"Government","A place built to house government officials in charge of a planet or sector, or so current theory claims, as nothing is known about the structure of Ársaidh society."
"Entertainment","A place to relax and be distracted, usually among soothing shapes, bathing areas and entertainment technology."
"Tomb","A place to remember the fallen. These facilities range from singular monolithic tombs to large cemeteries and memory halls. Despite the name, no Ársaidh corpses have ever been recovered—these places are always empty."
"Industrial Production","A Site for producing Ársaidh goods and technologies. They range from small-scale labs to cavernous halls full of strange machinery."
