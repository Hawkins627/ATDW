"Yellow fumes emerging from the earth’s depths."
"A field of eerie phosphorescent plant-like lifeforms."
"A narrow valley carpeted with thorny vines."
"A waterfall, thick and slimy and green with algae."
"Yellow sulphuric clouds, forming strange patterns."
"A soft, almost ash-like substance floating on the wind, sticking to all surfaces and dyeing them red."
"Dozens of small creatures feeding off a large, days-old carcass."
"Rock formations, corroded by the toxic elements, left with serrated edges and bone-like patterns."
"The bleached bones of dozens of large creatures, somehow impervious to the elements."
"Large clouds of insect-like creatures, far away but still clearly visible due to their number."
