"Encounter. Roll a Planetside Encounter."
"A poisonous marsh, its toxic fumes hell on any suit’s air filters. If crossed, there’s a 1 in 6 chance the air filtration system in a suit fails, requiring a successful Technology check to be repaired."
"A sludge-covered plain, difficult to traverse (+1🕒)."
"A jungle-like area full of prehensile vines which attempt to grab the crew members. All characters must pass a DEX check to avoid being entangled (STR check to escape). Each failed attempt causes +1🕒."
"A random character suddenly realizes they have been poisoned somehow (random severity)."
"A perfectly spherical metal globe, the size of a small house, sits in the middle of an empty field. If approached, roll a D20: 1–10) its surface is textured to reveal the contents of all adjacent hexes; 11–19) a blast of energy shocks a random character, dealing 2D20 damage; 20) an orifice opens in its side, revealing a strange metal gauntlet that immediately adjusts itself to the wearer’s anatomy. The wearer can somehow move metal objects no larger than a beach ball at a distance of 20’."
"The ground collapses out from under the characters’ feet. They fall inside a spongy but highly corrosive surface. They must climb out the 10’ hole in less than 5 rounds or their boots dissolve (followed by their feet, legs, etc.)."
"A large lake of acid occupies this area, forcing the crew to go around it +2🕒."
"A field of fungal lifeforms—small, white and spherical—covers this whole hex. They explode in a splash of acid when touched, dealing D20 damage in a 3’ radius, so all characters must pass a Stealth check to avoid disturbing the fungi."
