Encounter. Only Guardians may be encountered here.
A steep cliff forces the crew to go around this hex.
"An electro-magnetic disturbance fries your GPS—you’ve lost track of where the ship landed. Each time you enter a Hex (explored or not), there’s a cumulative 10% chance that the ship is there."
"A storm of micro-meteorites slams all around you, forcing you to spend +D4 ⦾ taking cover."
"A thin, bridge-like stone structure seemed the only way to cross a dangerous spot. Unfortunately, it collapses under the weight of a random character, who takes D20 damage and must find a way back up the 20’ fall."
"A random character steps into some sort of quicksand and must pass a Normal difficulty DEX check or slowly sink. With each failed check, the difficulty increases by one step (from Normal to Almost Impossible). Failing the last check means they’re gone for good. Other characters may assist with ropes or any other available gear."
"The ground falls out from under the characters’ feet. Every character takes D20 damage and they must find a way back up the 20+D20’ fall."
"A dust storm impedes visibility, forcing the crew to wait in place for +D4 ⦾."
"The earth starts to shake violently as large cracks open all around the crew. All characters must spend 1 Luck or fall inside, never to be seen again."
