description
"A quiet plane, bathed in the pale purple light that filters through the atmosphere."
"A mercury lake, its still surface as reflective as a mirror."
"A field of strange flower-like ice formations."
"A stunning multi-colored arch, clearly the result of erosion but nonetheless breathtaking for its otherworldly beauty."
"Large tentacle-like biological structures rising several dozen feet from the ground, swaying in the wind."
"A waterfall, hundreds of feet tall, more likely liquid hydrogen or methane than water."
"Bulbous egg-like formations grow out from the side of a cliff. It’s unclear if they’re organic or a product of the planet’s chemistry."
"Sharp, dagger-like rock formations rise from the soil, hundreds of feet tall and wide."
"An enormous cave, its ceiling far above and at least a mile wide."
"An enormous metal spire, clearly artificial, erected atop a hill that appears to be a giant diamond."
