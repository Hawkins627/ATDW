"Encounter","The crew runs into something. This is rarely good news."
"Resources","Tools, data crystals, A-Metal cubes—these are what Divers risk their lives for (and what the KSA is willing to pay for)."
"Xenoanthropological Artifact","Cultural, historical, or ethnologically interesting finds. These include notes on architectural elements, pictograms, art—anything that might describe the Årsaidh (or another civilization)."
"Hazard Manifestation","An encounter with the Site Hazard (the Site’s defining threat or obstacle)."
"Locked Access Point","A closed door (or similar barrier) that the crew must bypass to progress."
"Dread Event","Not everything a crew encounters has a direct, rational explanation. The universe is a big place and the insignificant human mind cannot comprehend its vastness."
"Automated Security Measures","At the end of the day, a crew of Divers are no better than tomb robbers breaking into places they shouldn’t be in. Sometimes those places fight back."
"Fixed Event","A clearly defined problem or circumstance for the crew to deal with."
"Random Occurrence","This result requires the GM or solo player to interpret a few words, in the light of recent events and the type of Site the crew is in, to produce some unique challenge or situation."
