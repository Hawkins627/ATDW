"Encounter. Roll a Planetside Encounter."
"The ground shakes violently, throwing all crew members to their knees. There’s a 1 in 6 chance rubble from nearby buildings falls down on the characters—each crew member must pass a DEX check or suffer D4 wounds."
"An impossibly high barrier blocks the crew’s path, forcing them to walk around it (+1🜂)."
"A thick cloud of radioactive gas floats over this hex. Entering it inflicts 50 rads."
"An ancient bridge made of some concrete-like material is the only way to get across a canyon. Unfortunately, it collapses under the weight of a random character, who takes D20 damage and must find a way back up from the 20’ fall."
"A swarm of small bat-like creatures emerges from a nearby building, crowding around the crew. All characters must pass a Resolve check or gain D10 Stress."
"The ground falls out from under the characters’ feet. Every character takes D20 damage and they must find a way back up the 20+ D20’ fall."
"A thick, smoke-like fog impedes visibility, forcing the crew to wait in place for +D4🜂."
"The crew inadvertently activates an automated defense system. Ancient turrets emerge from the ground and spray a quick-set foam that solidifies on contact, becoming as hard as concrete. Characters must pass a DEX test to avoid being hit, failing means they’re stuck in place and must find a way of freeing themselves."
