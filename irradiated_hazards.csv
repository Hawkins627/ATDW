"Encounter. Roll a Planetside Encounter."
"A deep lake of highly radioactive water, which forces the crew to go around this hex."
"A sludge-covered plain, difficult to traverse (+1🜂)."
"A thick cloud of radioactive gas floats over this hex. Entering it inflicts 50 rads."
"A thin, bridge-like stone structure seemed the only way to cross a dangerous spot. Unfortunately, it collapses under the weight of a random character, who takes D20 damage and must find a way back up from the 20’ fall."
"A sudden flash flood of toxic water emerges from behind the crew. Unless one character passes a Perception check, all characters must pass a DEX check to jump to safety in time or else take D100 rads and be dragged D6 miles away."
"The ground falls out from under the characters’ feet. Every character takes D20 damage and they must find a way back up the 20+D20’ fall."
"A thick, smoke-like fog impedes visibility, forcing the crew to wait in place for +D4🜂."
"Strange, mushroom-like lifeforms, like 7’ tall white, sticky balloons, extend for miles around the crew. They are very sensitive to noise—all characters must pass a Stealth check to avoid disturbing them. On failure, the lifeforms shrivel and die, but not before shooting an extremely acidic substance in a 5’ radius. Adjacent characters suffer 3D10 damage (unless they are wearing DrakeSkin with an Armor Module Class C)."
