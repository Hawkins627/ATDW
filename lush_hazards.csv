"Encounter. Roll a Planetside Encounter."
"If every character fails a Perception check, they fail to realize they’re about to step onto a thin membrane. With a violent contraction, a random character is slowly but surely enveloped—they suffer D10 damage every round until freed, whether by another character or with their own tools and quick thinking."
"A shrieking, flying creature suddenly appears and attempts to grab a random character. They must pass a DEX check or be taken away to the creature’s nest on a high mountain peak D20 miles away."
"A blood-curdling howl freezes the whole crew in place. All characters must pass a Resolve check or gain 10 Stress."
"The ground falls out from under the characters’ feet. Every character takes D20 damage and they must find a way back up the 20+D20’ fall."
"A thick, heavy fog impedes visibility, forcing the crew to wait in place for +D4🕒."
"A random character must pass a Perception check or step on a strange translucide sack. If they fail, it explodes and releases a spider-like creature which immediately attempts to bite them. Only a DrakeSkin with an Armor Module Class A or higher can resist the attack. If bitten, the character must pass a CON check or become infected (see page 85)."
