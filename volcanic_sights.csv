"An erupting volcano, far in the distance."
"Black, menacing clouds gathering above."
"A spectacular lightning storm, illuminating an apocalyptic landscape."
"Two different lava flows, meeting and merging into a wide slow-flowing river of molten rock."
"Large boulders falling from a mountain and splashing into a lake of lava."
"A rare bout of rain, sizzling a recent lava flow, hardening it and creating huge steam clouds."
"A large pool of bubbly molten metal."
"Ancient metal archways, the remains of an old lava tunnel that passed through and melted an iron vein."
"A lava “waterfall,” dripping from a mile-high volcano."
"A field of lava geysers, each creating a column of fire dozens of feet tall."
