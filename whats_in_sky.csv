"An ominous black hole looms over the planet, not a star in sight."
"Three moons orbit the planet, of different sizes and at different speeds."
"Ancient battle debris litters the sky and occasionally falls to the planet. Most of them burn during re-entry."
"An artificial ring surrounds the planet across its equator."
"Thick yellow clouds cover the sky completely."
"Enormous creatures float high above, their bloated bodies too delicate to ever touch the surface."
"Clouds of artificial satellites orbit the planet."
"A thick column of black smoke, its place of origin past the horizon."
"A large meteor on a collision course with the planet. You probably have a few weeks, though."
"An asteroid belt."
"The fragments of what must have been a very large moon."
"Ominous lightning can be seen in the distance."
"Flocks of bat-like creatures fill the skies by the thousands, their shrieks sending a chill down your spine."
"Rock formations, some as large as mountains, defy gravity by floating in the air."
"A strange, cobweb-like substance falls from the sky, slowly but surely covering the surrounding landscape."
"An inconceivably large spaceship floats in low orbit, getting dangerously close to the planet."
"Colored air currents criss-cross the sky, creating a layered, painting-like spectacle."
"The planet’s magnetic field creates an effect very similar to Earth’s Aurora Borealis, visible even during daytime."
"During daytime, a bright red sun shines high above, bathing the planet with its red light."
"Strange floating sheets of vegetation, impossibly large, carried high by atmospheric currents."
