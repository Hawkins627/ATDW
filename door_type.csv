"Alarm Door","Tampering with this door will trigger a silent alarm. A Perception check is required to detect the alarm and a Technology check is required to turn it off. Failure to pick the lock or disable the alarm will trigger an Encounter."
"Dread Door","Something feels wrong about this door—your head feels dizzy when you look at it. Characters must pass a Resolve check to interact with it."
"Heart Door","Crossing this door’s threshold causes all characters to become Composed."
"Secure Door","A particularly difficult door. When attempting to open it with a LKPK, roll two Access Node dice and pick the worse result."
"Flame Door","This door’s threshold has extra security measures. When crossed, a sheet of intense flames jets from the top. This requires a Perception check to detect and a Technology check to disarm."
"Mind Door","Upon crossing this door’s threshold, it becomes apparent that this was not meant for a human mind. A sharp psychic pain strikes all characters (+D20 Stress), leaving them convulsing until they can crawl away from the door."
"Electric Field Door","This door has a powerful electric field which causes batteries to explode. Upon crossing its threshold, a random character loses 1xBattery and receives D10 damage."
"Flesh Door","A mass of fleshy matter blocks the way, with only a valve-like orifice allowing passage through. Squeezing through is not actually difficult, but the experience causes all characters to gain D4 Stress."
"One Way Door","This innocuous threshold allows characters to cross it in one direction, but a force field blocks any attempts to cross back through it."
"Standard Door","A normal door made of strong metal."
