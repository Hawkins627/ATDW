description
"A river of molten metal, slowly oozing downhill."
"An everburning pillar of fire, a dozen feet tall."
"A lake of boiling water."
"A large plain covered in a knee-deep layer of ash."
"A volcanic eruption, far in the distance but still dramatic and awe-inspiring."
"A steaming rock surface, its surface recently congealed into strange, smooth shapes."
"A deep chasm, the glow of molten lava far below."
"An artificial structure resembling a chimney. Black smoke emerges from the top."
"A valley carved by the passage of molten lava, which left behind gigantic diamond-like pillars."
"A clearly artificial channel dug in the hard stone surface, somehow still flowing with cold running water, which quickly plunges off a mountainside."
