"Encounter. Roll a Planetside Encounter."
"A steep cliff forces the crew to go around this hex."
"A field of loose gravel makes crossing this hex a difficult task (+1🜂)."
"Small frozen balls of an unidentified substance cover the next several miles, making progress difficult and treacherous. Characters must pass a DEX check or fall and twist their leg (-2 DEX until they can rest properly)."
"A thin, bridge-like stone structure seemed the only way to cross a dangerous spot. Unfortunately, it collapses under the weight of a random character, who takes D20 damage and must find a way back up from the 20’ fall."
"Acid rain begins to pour relentlessly, forcing the crew to find cover fast or suffer real damage. Each crew member can attempt one Survival check to find the crew proper cover. Each failure causes 2D20 damage."
"The ground falls out from under the characters’ feet. Every character takes D20 damage and they must find a way back up the 20+D20’ fall."
"A hailstorm impedes visibility, forcing the crew to wait in place for +D4🜂."
"If every character fails a Perception check, they fail to realize they’re walking on thin ice. With a loud crack, a random character falls into the icy cold water—they must pass a CON check (unless they’re wearing a thermal layer) or pass out and sink to their death, unless somehow rescued by another character."
