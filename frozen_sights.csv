"A large, furry creature, scurrying away."
"A huge, violent snowstorm, fortunately very far from your position."
"Incredible ice pillars, eroded by centuries of wind."
"A frozen waterfall, hundreds of feet wide."
"A strange, perfectly circular hole, approximately 50’ in diameter."
"Enormous blocks of ice, 300’ on each side, spread across a wide plain."
"A desolate plain crisscrossed by large crevasses."
"Strange tree-like formations made entirely of ice."
"An enormous ice cave, its stalactites the size of buildings."
"A column of fire, belched from the depths of an ice crevasse. Reddish snow covers its perimeter. A Science roll reveals the red snow is most likely methane snow, contaminated by traces of hydrocarbons."
