1,"Alarm","A disquieting sound emerges from everywhere at once. A character must pass a Technology check to turn it off, or else an Encounter takes place."
1,"Teleport","Each crew member is teleported to a random location."
1,"Stasis","A force field traps two random crew in permanent stasis—unable to move or act in any way. A Science check will reveal how to undo the Stasis (e.g. overloading the stasis field, finding the source of the field, disabling its power source). Characters in stasis remain there indefinitely, until they can be rescued."
1,"Nanites","A cloud of aggressive nanites is released. They surround a random character, inflicting 1 Wound/round. The most effective way to deal with them is with fire, but be open to alternate solutions such as freezing them or electrocuting them. They will move from character to character until there’s nobody left."
1,"Combustible Gas","The Area is filled with highly combustible gas, only detectable via an active Atmospheric Sensor which should give the crew enough time to exit the Area. If undetected, the gas combusts moments later, causing D20 damage to all characters within the Area."
1,"Electricity Field","Bolts of electricity shoot from all directions, inflicting D10+10 damage to all characters within the Area. The field lasts 1 round, but reactivates each time any character enters the Area."
1,"Lock Down","The Site enters a Lockdown protocol. All undiscovered Areas become Locked, including the one the characters are presently in."
1,"Sonic Blast","An extremely unpleasant noise fills the Area. All characters suffer minor hearing damage and a -2 to Perception checks for the remainder of the expedition."
1,"Turret","An automated turret emerges from the wall (Ranged Weapon skill 12, D20 damage), shooting at a random character each round until deactivated or destroyed."
1,"Gravity Reversal","Upon entering this Area, all characters must pass a DEX check to avoid receiving 1 Wound as they suddenly “fall” toward the ceiling. Not only is the gravity flip permanent, but there’s a 20% chance that the whole Site has had its gravity reversed."
