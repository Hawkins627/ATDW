"Strange, four-winged creatures circle high above."
"A pack of lupine creatures follow the crew for a while, before losing interest."
"Two very large creatures battling up in the sky."
"Snarls and growls can be heard around the crew, before dying off."
"A herd of very large creatures, seemingly heading your way, which turn away at the last moment."
"Bones litter the area, most of them ancient but some more than a few days old."
"A large standing stone covered with deep claw marks."
"A haunting, ululating howl can be heard not too far away."
"An enormous creature, dozens of feet tall, wanders near the crew and either ignores them or simply doesn’t notice them."
"Thousands of small creatures burrow out from the ground, surrounding the crew before simply moving away from the area as fast as they can."
"The remains of a large creature, partially devoured, block the path forward. It’s a fresh kill—whatever took this thing down is likely nearby."
"Fresh tracks, like those of a large snake, crisscross ahead."
"Tentacle-like appendages burst up around the crew, missing them by mere inches."
"A wailing creature with dozens of small, extremely long legs runs ahead of the crew, chased by a lizard-looking beast."
"A crew member unknowingly steps on some sort of fungal growth. Seconds after the crew moves ahead, a cloud of spores explodes behind them with a violent burst."
"A swarm of extremely delicate creatures suddenly surrounds the crew, momentarily blinding them. As they collide with the crew, they burst and dye all their gear and suits a bright pink."
"Whisper-like sounds surround the crew, their source impossible to pinpoint."
"A few feet ahead of the crew’s current path, a single burst of laser fire leaves a scorched mark on the soil."
"A blood-chilling roar freezes the crew in place, lasting several seconds and echoing across the landscape."
"A large creature, 10’ long and with a menacing horned head, lies dead ahead. Upon close inspection, the cause of death is, without a doubt, firearm wounds. It seems recent."
