"Encounter. Roll a Planetside Encounter."
"A steep cliff forces the crew to go around this hex."
"A huge frozen lake, sleek and mirror-like, makes crossing this hex a difficult task (+1⟳)."
"Razor-like shards of ice cover this area, making progress difficult and dangerous. There’s a 1 in 6 chance a random character slashes their vacc or hazard suit (unless it’s armored)."
"A thin, bridge-like stone structure seemed the only way to cross a dangerous spot. Unfortunately, it collapses under the weight of a random character, who takes D20 damage and must find a way back up from the 20’ fall."
"Large sharp ice shards fall from above in a violent hail. Unless a crew member passes a Survival check, every crew member takes 3D10 damage."
"The ground falls out from under the characters’ feet. Every character takes D20 damage and they must find a way back up the 20+D20’ fall."
"A thick, smoke-like fog impedes visibility, forcing the crew to wait in place for +D4⟳."
"If every character fails a Perception check, they fail to realize they’re walking on thin ice. With a loud crack, a random character falls into the icy cold water—they must pass a CON check (unless they’re wearing a thermal layer) or pass out and sink to their death, unless somehow rescued by another character."
