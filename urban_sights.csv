"A colossal tower with no visible entrance or windows, topped by a minaret."
"A steep canyon, its walls covered with hanging buildings."
"Rubble-covered terrain, as far as the eye can see. The only remains of what once must have been a large city."
"A large dome, covering the ruins of some sort of square."
"A multi-leveled road system, criss-crossed a hundred different ways."
"A series of arches rising above the rubble."
"A pair of tall skyscrapers creating an artificial valley."
"A wide, circular plaza, stairs spiraling downwards to a collapsed underground facility."
"A wide avenue, surprisingly free of rubble, with low, square buildings at each side."
"A series of pools, in neat rows of three, extending for miles into the distance."
